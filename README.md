# My personal website ðŸ‘‹

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b46f6f20-0ca5-46c9-8a6a-c85dc45572db/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/alexanderpowell/deploys)

My personal website, built using [Jigsaw](https://github.com/tightenco/jigsaw) as a static site generator, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for a utility first approach to styling.

The site aims to house information about myself, my CV, and perhaps one day - a blog!
